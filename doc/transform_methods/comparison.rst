Comparison of Abel Transform Methods
====================================


Introduction
------------

Each new Abel transform method claims to be the best, providing a lower-noise, more accurate transform. The point of PyAbel is to provide an easy platform to try several abel transform methods and determine which provides the best results for a specific dataset.

So far, we have found that for a high-quality dataset, all of the transform methods produce good results.


Speed benchmarks
----------------
The :class:`abel.benchmark.AbelTiming` class provides the ability to benchmark the relative speed of the Abel transform algorithms.
