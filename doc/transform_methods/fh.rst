Fourier-Hankel
==============


Introduction
------------

The Fourier-Hankel method break the Abel transform in to a Fourier transform and a Hankel transform. It takes advantage of the fact there there are fast numerical implementations of the Fourier and Hankel transforms to provide a quick alorithm. It is known to produce artifacts in the transform [Dribinski2002]_

This method is not yet implemented in PyAbel. See the discussion in Issue `#26 <https://github.com/PyAbel/PyAbel/issues/24>`_ for more information.


How it works
------------

It doesn't work in PyAbel yet.


When to use it
--------------

To compare with other methods? Very large images?


How to use it
-------------

Implement it!
